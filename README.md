# What I found interesting
The website linked above is the portfolio of software developer Bruno Simons, which he created with Three.js (the 3D library of Javascript). What I found interesting was the fact that his portfolio is a project itself. It is my first time seeing such an interactive portfolio. You can use the arrow keys to travel through it like a fully functioning game. He even included sound effects for the car as it moved around the screen. Very impressive work.

I've seen this portfolio before and thought it was very impressive and fun. It was also my first time seeing a portoflio this interactive. I liked how it shows how creative one can be and make it as personalized as you want.
